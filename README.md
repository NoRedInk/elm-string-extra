# DEPRECATED: use [elm-community/string-extra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/string-extra/latest) instead


# Convenience functions for working with Strings in Elm

These functions supplement Elm's core [String package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/String).
